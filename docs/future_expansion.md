# Future Expansion Roadmap

This home lab environment is continuously evolving. Planned improvements include:

---

## Network Segmentation (VLAN Implementation)

Future iterations will explore VLAN segmentation to:

- Separate media, experimentation, and infrastructure traffic
- Improve security boundaries between services
- Reduce broadcast domain congestion

This will provide hands-on experience with managed switch configuration and structured network segmentation.

---

## Centralized Reverse Proxy

Implementation of a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Traefik) to:

- Consolidate service routing
- Simplify SSL certificate management
- Improve external access control

---

## Monitoring & Observability

Future additions may include:

- Container resource monitoring dashboards
- Uptime tracking
- Centralized logging aggregation

This would improve operational visibility and incident response.

---

## Backup & Snapshot Strategy Enhancement

Expanding backup procedures to include:

- Automated scheduled backups
- VM snapshot rotation
- External redundancy options

This strengthens system resilience and recovery capability.

---

## Multi-Node Scaling (Long-Term Goal)

Transitioning from single-node architecture to a multi-node cluster for:

- High availability experimentation
- Load balancing studies
- Distributed service deployment

This would simulate small-scale production infrastructure.
